GENERAL_BACKGROUND = '''
This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a
mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame
corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated
games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of
rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,
players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select
an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of
legal game actions during each action phase.\n
'''

GM_BACKGROUND_KNOWLEDGE = GENERAL_BACKGROUND + '''
We focus on minigames that are social dilemmas, collective action problems, or
bargaining problems.

A minigame consists of the following:
1) a game representation such as a Schelling diagram which maps joint actions to
rewards per player.
2) a cover story to tell the players about the setting.
3) a way of understanding how actions described in natural language map to game
actions.
4) specific information to tell all players about the setting at the start.
5) the true number of rounds the minigame will run (unknown to the players).
